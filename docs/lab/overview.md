A lab environment has been created to give you all the software you need to begin working with Kubedirctor.

The lab environment runs inside a [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) VM and uses [Vagrant](http://vagrant.io/) to automate the setting up the Virtualbox VM with the tools needed to work with Kubedirctor.

Don't worry if you haven't used Vagrant before.  Vagrant is very simple to use and this site will walk you through everything you need to know.
