This site is split into five sections:

- **Introduction** (this section)
- [**Lab Installation**](/docs/lab/overview) - install a lab for KD
- [**KD Overview**](/docs/about-kd/intro) - KD goals, concepts and terminology.
- [**Using KD**](/docs/kd-user/intro) - learn how to use KD
- [**KD Image Development**](/docs/kd-img-dev/overview) - learn how to create KD images
- [**KD Development**](/docs/kd-dev/overview) - learn how to hack KD itself

Each section builds on the previous section.

You only need to take the sections to meeet your own learning goals.  For example, if you are only interested in learning how to administer KubeDirector, you can stop when you have finished the section **Using KD**.
