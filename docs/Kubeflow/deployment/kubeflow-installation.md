### Kubeflow Deployment on Kubernetes Cluster Creation 

Kubeflow can be deployed on Kubernetes cluster creation by specifying `Enable Kubeflow` checkbox in Application Configurations tab.   

#### Authentication Setup 

Kubeflow supports both Active Directory and LDAP platform authentication. 

Currently, there are some restrictions related to Dex component functionality: 

- Direct Bind type is not supported by Dex; 

- External Groups donâ€™t influence authorization at all due to such behavior is not supported by Dex. A user that does not belong to the external group is able to login into Kubeflow dashboard: https://stackoverflow.com/q/58276195/9431509, https://github.com/dexidp/dex/issues/1562. 

#### Application Configurations Setup 

Select the following option from the list of applications: `Enable Kubeflow`. 

You may need to specify `Enable Spark` option as well in order to enable compute functionality. 

#### Air Gap 

If Air Gap is configured on the platform, notice that all the required images should be pushed to the registry before Kubeflow installation.  

See the list of images to be installed in the [relative section](mlops/docs/Kubeflow/architecture/kubeflow-images-list). 

### Validating the Result of Kubeflow Components Deployment 

When your Kubernetes cluster is ready run the following command on the master node to ensure kubeflow-operator pod is healthy:  

```
$ kubectl get pods -n kubeflow-operator  

NAME                                      READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE 
dex-cm-generator-9xn97                    0/1     Completed   0          3m 
hpecpconfig-patch-vqzhm                   0/1     Completed   0          3m 
kubeflow-operator-68bdd75b8b-gpkzx        1/1     Running     0          3m 
local-path-provisioner-5fd8f5bbb8-hjtqq   1/1     Running     0          3m 
``` 

Confirm that Dex config map was created according to the authentication settings provided on cluster creation: 

`$ kubectl get secret dex-config-secret -n auth -oyaml`

Deployment of Kubeflow manifests may take 10-15 minutes. Check the pods are up and running using the command below: 

`$ kubectl get pods -n istio-system && kubectl get pods -n kubeflow && kubectl get pods -n auth`

The output should look like the following:

```

### Kubeflow Deployment post Kubernetes Cluster Creation 

Kubeflow can be installed post Kubernetes cluster creation. Edit your cluster by selecting `Enable Kubeflow` check-box on Application Configurations tab. Save changes and wait until cluster is ready and Kubeflow services are up and running. 

### Uninstall Kubeflow 

In order to uninstall Kubeflow you need to remove your Kubernetes cluster.
