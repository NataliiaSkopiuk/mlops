Kubedirector is itself a Kubernetes operator. It is designed to make it easier to launch and manage applications on Kubernetes. KD provides a framework and a set of commonly used Operator functionality.  It is not a replacement for Operators in all cases, rather it is tool so that many applications can be deployed and managed on Kubernetes without the need for writing an application specfic Operator.
